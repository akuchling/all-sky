all-sky HTML image manipulator
==============================

Displays images and allows combining them together.


Requirements
------------

Can be used in any HTML5 browser.


Trying it out
-------------

Currently the files need to be retrieved via an HTTP server; the various
paths are not correct for running directly from the local file system.
You can run a basic local server by remaining in the same directory as
this README and then running the command::

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

You can then view the app by going to http://localhost:8000/.

Tasks
-----

Polish the design

Limit the user to selecting at most three images

Display the legend for each image

Set the URL dynamically
